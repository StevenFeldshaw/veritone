## Prerequisites
Before we get started, you'll need to make sure you have a few things in place:
Node.js: If you don't already have Node.js installed, you can download it from here.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository:
Open your command line or terminal and type this command, replacing <repository-url> with the actual URL of the repository:
git clone <repository-url>

### Navigate to the Project Directory:
Change your working directory to the newly created 'shopping-list-frontend' folder:
### `cd shopping-list-frontend`

### Install Dependencies:
Now, we'll need to install all the packages and libraries that the application relies on:
### `npm install`

### Start the Development Server:
### `npm start`

### Open the App:
Visit http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to start using the app.

## Folder Structure
Here's how the project's folders are organized:

* src/: This is where all the source code for the frontend application resides.
* public/: The 'public' folder holds assets and the main index.html file.
* node_modules/: All the Node.js packages and dependencies are stored here.

## Available Scripts
While working on the project, you can use the following scripts:

* npm start: This starts the development server.
* npm test: Run this command to execute the test suite.
* npm run build: Use this script to build the application for production.

## Running Tests
To run the test suite and make sure everything is working correctly, run the following command:

### `npm test`

## Deployment
When you're ready to deploy the application for production, you can use this command:

### `npm run build
This will generate a production-ready version of the app in the 'build/' directory, which you can then deploy to your preferred hosting platform.

## Built with
The frontend is built with the following technologies:

* React: A JavaScript library for creating user interfaces.
* Material-UI: A popular framework for building React-based user interfaces.
* axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to your server.
* Tailwind: A popular open source CSS framework for aesthetic styling of the app.
